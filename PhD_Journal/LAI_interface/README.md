## Software interface

Preparation for, and application of, local ancestry inference approaches to data simulated from
controled sources. 

Jupyter notebooks reproduce tests of classification at different genetic distances. samples IDs 
are attributed ancestry proportions and sequences concatenated across tests.


**Notebook Admixture_simulations_Loter**
Application of software Loter (Dias-Alves *et al*. 2018) to concatenated test samples. Individual 
admixture proportions used. Population number and population size are adjustable.

Visit the Loter [GitHub](https://github.com/bcm-uga/Loter) for installation details.
